# Excelsior
Excelsior, 34 keys unisplit ortho with staggered pinkies &amp; 25mm trackball, optional RGB strip.

# Description
Excelsior is a heavily modified version of Endzone34 which has been blessed by takashicompany himself for the mod. [Endzone34](https://github.com/takashicompany/endzone34) was originally designed by takashicompany.

A List Of Mods Made To The Original PCB by [takashicompany](https://github.com/takashicompany/endzone34):

-PCB was created from scratch using the outline shape of Endzone34 using EasyEDA.

-A circular hole was created in the middle that can accomodate either a 25mm trackball powered by PMW3360 sensor.

-Base of the trackball holder with lens cut out is integrated into the top case with integrated 5mm switch plate. Top case sits flush with pcb.

-This PCB is capable of hot swap, Kailh.

-Full keyboard case was created to house the PCB.

-MCU area is now hidden and have an extrude of a [Starship logo](https://www.clipartmax.com/middle/m2i8Z5m2d3b1K9m2_star-trek-ship-icon-icon/)

-Excelsior is powered by [RP2040 Zero Raspberry Pi SuperMini Pico](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007292787135.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.136.6e251802pcq7qH) which you can get from AE and is soldered at the bottom of the pcb flush to the pcb.

-For diodes, I decided to try out the [BAV70](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Switching-Diode_Jiangsu-Changjing-Electronics-Technology-Co-Ltd-BAV70_C68978.html) so that I solder less diodes since this pcb
is not sponsored. I would only need to solder on 17 diodes instead of 34.

-PCB has the option of RGB strip and the power 5v has the proper power level shifter component soldered on. Initially I was gonna do individual 34 RGBs but too much work and I don't use RGBs that often.

-QMK code is borrowed from aki27 bally and modified the matrix to fit my Excelsior. No suppport will be given since I just copy and paste.

-Keycaps I prefer high profile ones, MT3 or SA.

-Use M2 brass hot inserts 3.2mm diameter and 4mm length for the M2 screws to secure the case. I forgot how long is my M2 screws are but they should be greater than 10mm so estimated around 14.6mm. Play around with and buy multiple M2 lenght screws.

# Full Production Pictures
TBA. Currently Sept 13, 2024, the PCBs are in transit from JLCPCB.
